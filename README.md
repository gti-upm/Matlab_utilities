* [HebiRobotics/HebiCam](https://github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam) [[Fork]](https://github.com/gti-upm/HebiCam). HebiCam is a MATLAB class that supports live video acquisition from a variety of sources. It is similar in functionality to MATLAB's IP Camera support package, but provides support for a wider range of formats. HebiCam uses JavaCV, and thus supports all formats that are supported by OpenCV and FFMpeg, including h264 and mjpeg streams. USB cameras are supported on Windows and OSX.
* video2images: video to image conversion scripts. 
* from_txt_to_csv_mat: convert ".xml" ground truth file generated from viper to both ".csv" and ".mat" files.
